    <h1>Privacy Policy - FUTEMAX</h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the <strong>FUTEMAX app</strong> (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by [YOUR DEVELOPER/COMPANY NAME] (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>

    <!-- Information Collection and Use -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>
        The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)</li>
        <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
        <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
        <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
        <li>Device identifiers such as Advertising ID (IDFA on iOS, AAID on Android)</li>
        <li>App usage statistics and interaction patterns</li>
        <li>App crash reports and performance data</li>
        <li>General location information (not precise GPS coordinates)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- App Tracking Transparency (ATT) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>App Tracking Transparency (iOS Users)</h2>
      <p>
        For iOS users on iOS 14.5 or later, the Application will request permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. This tracking technology uses your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA) to help deliver personalized advertisements to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        When prompted by the system, you can choose to either allow or deny tracking. If you select "Allow," the Application will be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show you personalized advertisements based on your interests and activities</li>
        <li>Measure the effectiveness of advertisements you see or interact with</li>
        <li>Provide advertisers with aggregated information about ad performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you select "Ask App Not to Track," we will respect your choice and will not track your activity across other companies' apps and websites for advertising purposes. You may still see advertisements, but they will be less relevant to your interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change your tracking preferences at any time in your device's Settings app under Privacy > Tracking.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Location Data Usage -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Location Data Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Location permission is completely <strong>optional</strong> in the Application. If you choose to grant location permission when prompted, the Application may collect general location information. The Application may also collect and process general location information through your IP address and network information. This general location data may be used to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide regionally relevant content, including local sports events and matches</li>
        <li>Comply with regional broadcasting and streaming regulations</li>
        <li>Improve service performance by connecting to geographically closer servers</li>
        <li>Enable certain features that may only be available in specific regions</li>
        <li>Deliver more relevant advertisements (if you've allowed personalized ads)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device's settings. Denying location permission will not affect the core functionality of the Application. You can also limit the collection of location-related information by using a VPN service. The Service Provider retains location data for as long as necessary to provide services and comply with legal obligations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Regional Targeting -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Regional Targeting</h2>
      <p>
        The Application may use collected information to provide regionally targeted content and advertisements. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Displaying sporting events and matches relevant to your region</li>
        <li>Adjusting content availability according to regional licensing agreements</li>
        <li>Providing advertisements that comply with local regulations and customs</li>
        <li>Customizing user interface elements based on regional preferences</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regional targeting is performed automatically based on the information collected during your use of the Application. The Service Provider implements measures to ensure that such targeting complies with applicable regional laws and regulations concerning content distribution and advertising standards.
      </p>

        <li>Compliance with data caps and fair usage policies</li>
        <li>Security monitoring and threat detection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Application may function differently depending on your network connection type and provider. Certain features may be unavailable or limited on specific networks due to technical limitations or network policies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Advertising and Analytics -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
      <p>

      </ul>
      <p>

    <!-- Third Party Access -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
